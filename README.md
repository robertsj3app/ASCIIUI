Text based GUI modules for Perl. Currently includes Buttons, MessageBoxes, InputFields, Text, GroupBoxes (partial implementation), Hotkeys, and Scenes for managing GUI items.

Windows Terminal currently breaks the console window size functionality. Can be used on Windows Terminal if not resizing console window. Use Windows Console Host for best compatibility.
